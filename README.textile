h1. Volley android project mavenized

h2. You don't know what is Volley

Watch this "video":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhv8l9F44qo

Please note this is NOT the official volley project, it is just a restructure of the official one that uses maven.

Want to use the real one ?

<pre><code>
git clone https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/volley
</pre></code>

h2. How to use it

Clone it and run mvn clean install.

It will install locally the jar that you can then use in your pom with this dependency tag

<pre><code>
<groupId>com.android</groupId>
<artifactId>volley</artifactId>
<version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</code></pre>

h2. Project future

I will delete the project as soon as a better and official way to share the library is available. If you know please let me know :)

I may do some work to move out the tests from test/resources to make them work with maven, but later on
